# odin-recipes
Recipes project as part of The Odin Project

This project will be meant to show my profiency with the skills I have   |
learned during the HTML foundations portions of The Odin Project. This
will include the basics HTML such as paragraph elements, header elements,
lists, images, links, and more. 

During the initial writing of this README, the website will be completely 
bare, with no CSS nor JavaScript. However, the website will still have 
passable functionality in that it will allow for movement between pages,
links to external references, accessibility options, and more. 

Temporary or test entries within the recipes sections may be filled with
Lorem Ipsum and will eventually be fixed or discarded.
